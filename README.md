## :bulb: Key Learnings 
* Applied Python 3 fundamentals in Data Science and Machine Learning, with a focus on Finance.
* Leveraged Python for financial computations such as portfolio returns, risk and Sharpe ratio calculations.
* Built, trained, and tuned Machine Learning models with SciKit-Learn on real-world datasets, including application in banking and finance sectors for tasks such as stock price prediction, fraud detection, and customer segmentation.
* Gained insights into various Machine Learning algorithms for regression, classification and clustering tasks, and learned how to assess their performance using appropriate KPIs.
* Explored the theory and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and learned to optimize ANNs' hyperparameters for improved performance.
* Developed strong skills in feature engineering and data cleaning for Machine Learning and Data Science applications.
